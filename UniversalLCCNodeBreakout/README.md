# Universal LCC Node Breakout

This is a "breakout board" for use in breadboarding LCC nodes, typically using breadboard friendly MCU Dev Boards.  This board contains a 5V power supply taking from the LCC network.  It also contains a CAN transceiver and contains a pair of RJ45 connectors.  There is CAN termination and a place for a socket to access pins 4 and 5 ("Alt" pins) on the LCC network bus.

\maketitle

This is a circuit board that implements a FRED (Flashing Rear End 
Device)\footnote{Also know as an EOT (End Of Train) device.}. This little 
circuit board rides in the trailing truck of the last freight car of a train 
and flashes a LED mounted on a FRED riding in the trailing coupler of that 
freight car.

\section{Assembly}

The circuit board is mostly assembled.  It is necessary to solder on two small 
pieces of phosphor bronze that will be the wiper contacts to pick up power 
from the track. The two small pieces of phosphor bronze are soldered onto the 
labeled pad on the back side of the board and then bent into ``V'' shapes. It 
is also necessary to cut the board into two pieces, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:boardcut}. After cutting the boards apart, carefully sand the 
cuts flush.

Next cut two pieces of phosphor bronze sheet, 13.5mm x 16mm and solder them to 
the pads on the bottom at the ends of the nain board, with 12.5mm extending 
beyond the ends of the board.  Once soldered, bend the pieces up (under the 
board) as shown in the photo in Figure~\ref{fig:wiperphoto}.

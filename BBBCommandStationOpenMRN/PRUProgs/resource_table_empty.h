/*
 *  ======== resource_table_empty.h ========
 *
 *  Define the resource table entries for all PRU cores. This will be
 *  incorporated into corresponding base images, and used by the remoteproc
 *  on the host-side to allocated/reserve resources.  Note the remoteproc
 *  driver requires that all PRU firmware be built with a resource table.
 *
 *  This file contains an empty resource table.  It can be used either as:
 *
 *        1) A template, or
 *        2) As-is if a PRU application does not need to configure PRU_INTC
 *                  or interact with the rpmsg driver
